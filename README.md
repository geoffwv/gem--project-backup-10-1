# Gem::Project
Welcome to my first gem! The EPL Info Gem lists facts about the teams in the 2019-2020 English Premier League, the greatest football league in the world!
You can find out the name of your favorite (or least favorite) teams stadium, it capacity, where the team is actually from, and the nicknames for the team.
I hope you enjoy the gem and learn something about the teams of the EPL! Go Blues!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gem-project'
```
And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gem-project

## Usage

To run the gem you need to execute the file "epl" located in the bin directory. From there you will have the luxury of choosing which English Premier League team to find out more information on.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
