# Gem::Project
Welcome to my first CLI program! The EPL Info Gem lists facts about the teams in the 2019-2020 English Premier League, the greatest football league in the world!
You can find out the name of your favorite (or least favorite) teams stadium, it capacity, where the team is actually from, and the nicknames for the team.
I hope you enjoy the gem and learn something about the teams of the EPL! Go Blues!

## Installation
Make sure that Nokogiri and Pry are installed so all the requires will be fulfilled! You should be able to use the following command to install them if they aren't already on your system.

gem install nokogiri
gem install pry

## Usage

To run the app you need to execute the file "epl" located in the bin directory. From there you will have the luxury of choosing which English Premier League team to find out more information on.

Navigate your way to gem-project and run the following command:

ruby bin/epl

That will get you into the project and allow you to navigate your way around to find out facts about your favorite or most disliked EPL team>
